mailchunk...

Purpose
--------

  Mailchunk will aggregate emails for bulk sending to postfix to enable better queue management and delivery rates
  It acts as a drop in SMTP server eliminating the need to recode existing web-based mailers
 
How it Works (proposed ;)

  Mailchunk will accept mail connections and add the new mail to an existing buffer.
  When that buffer has reached QUEUE_LIMIT (conf param) emails it will be flushed to postfix
  Additionally if QUEUE_FLUSH_TIMEOUT is reached then the queue will be flushed

TO DO

  Most of the code ;)
  Add MIN_WAIT between queue flushes (e.g don't flush a queue within 60 seconds of last flush)
