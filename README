mailchunk...

Purpose
--------

  Mailchunk will aggregate emails for bulk sending to postfix (or other mail servers ?) 
  to enable better queue management (ie allow postfix to send multiple emails to the same domain using just one connection) 
  
  It acts as a drop in SMTP server eliminating the need to recode existing web-based mailers
 
How it Works (proposed ;)

  Mailchunk will accept mail connections and add the new mail to an existing buffer.
  When that buffer has reached BUFFER_LIMIT emails it should write that buffer to file (currently written to an array)
  When QUEUE_TIME has been reached up to QUEUE_LIMIT emails will be sent to the SMTP_SERVER

TO DO

  Use Files to send message chunks to
  Catch interrupts to ensure no mail loss
